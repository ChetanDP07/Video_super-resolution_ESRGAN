# Video_super-resolution_ESRGAN

This project aims to implement the ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks) algorithm for video super-resolution. 
ESRGAN is a state-of-the-art deep learning model that is capable of producing high-quality super-resolved images with natural textures and details.
